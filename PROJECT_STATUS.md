# PROJECT_STATUS.md

## Project identity

- **Project:** AI-Assisted Portfolio Management System
- **Type:** Browser-based web application
- **Team size:** 4
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Hakan Altınçay
- **Current backend stage:** Authentication and Portfolio CRUD are stable. The TEFAS backend MVP data foundation remains complete. The first Transaction vertical slice / Transaction foundation is now implemented and validated: BUY and SELL creation are supported, and Transactions remain the source of truth for ownership/quantity. Remaining TEFAS items are intentionally deferred and do not block the next backend slice.
- **Status updated:** 2026-08-25

## Product summary

The system allows an individual investor to track supported investment assets in manually entered portfolios and combines portfolio calculations, market/fund data, benchmark comparison and later AI-supported analysis.

The current backend already contains the authentication and portfolio foundation plus a substantial TEFAS data-integration layer. TEFAS daily fund data, fund-detail metadata, portfolio allocation data and multiple derived short-term metrics have been investigated, implemented and tested conservatively.

The project remains a decision-support and educational application. It does not execute trades or connect to bank/brokerage accounts.

| TEFAS daily raw data | Implemented | Core raw fields include fund code/name/date, price, shares outstanding, investor count, portfolio size and BYF exchange bulletin price where available |
| TEFAS scheduled daily sync | Complete / merged | Default scheduled sync runs YAT, EMK, BYF, GYF and GSYF sequentially using fund-kind-level bulk general-info requests; merged in PR #34 |
| TEFAS detail snapshot | Implemented | Includes fund category, 1-year category rank, category fund count, raw market-share value, official TEFAS risk value and source-oriented profile metadata |
| TEFAS portfolio allocation | Implemented / validated | 54 raw allocation fields observed; 43 mapped by same-date raw/UI verification; 11 preserved as unresolved/unobserved raw fields |
| TEFAS derived metrics | Implemented | Daily, five-observation and one-month performance/evolution metrics are available for the implemented raw series |
| TEFAS capability/gap analysis | Complete | Direct vs derived vs unavailable vs external-source-needed decisions documented for the data team |
| Official TEFAS risk value | Complete / merged | `profilData["riskDegeri"]` is normalized to `risk_value: int | None`, validated to 1..7 and persisted in detail snapshots |
| External source decision | Complete for current MVP | TEFAS is primary; KAP is preferred official supplementary source when needed; FVT is not a required backend dependency |
| AI integration | Not started in backend | Analytics, sentiment and report-Q&A integration remain later-stage work |
| Frontend integration | Not started in backend | Stable backend contracts will be provided as domains are finalized |

## Authentication and portfolio API

Implemented routes include:

```text
GET    /api/v1/health
POST   /api/v1/auth/register
POST   /api/v1/auth/login
GET    /api/v1/auth/me

POST   /api/v1/portfolios
GET    /api/v1/portfolios
GET    /api/v1/portfolios/{portfolio_id}
PATCH  /api/v1/portfolios/{portfolio_id}
DELETE /api/v1/portfolios/{portfolio_id}
```

Do not infer additional public API endpoints from internal TEFAS services unless they are explicitly implemented and registered.

## TEFAS daily-data capability

Verified daily business fields currently used by the backend:

- `fund_code`
- `fund_name`
- `data_date`
- `price`
- `shares_outstanding`
- `investor_count`
- `portfolio_size`
- `exchange_bulletin_price`

Important provider-specific behavior:

- BYF raw `kisiSayisi=0` was verified to represent unavailable investor-count data in tested observations and is normalized to `None`.
- `exchange_bulletin_price` was observed populated for BYF in the tested August 2026 dates.
- The same raw field was present but `NULL` in tested YAT, EMK, GYF and GSYF observations.
- Provider-specific semantics must remain inside the TEFAS integration/service layer.

## TEFAS detail snapshot capability

The backend detail-page metadata extraction and fund-detail snapshot persistence currently preserve source-oriented values for:

- `fund_category`
- `category_rank`
- `category_fund_count`
- `market_share_raw`
- `risk_value`
- `isin`
- `tefas_status`
- `transaction_start_time`
- `transaction_end_time`
- `entry_commission_raw`
- `exit_commission_raw`
- `interest_content`
- `fund_sale_valor`
- `fund_redemption_valor`

`category_rank` / `category_fund_count` were validated against the TEFAS detail-analysis semantics as the current 1-year category ranking and category fund count.

The official TEFAS 1–7 fund risk value is source-confirmed, extracted from exact-matching `profilData["riskDegeri"]`, validated to 1..7 and persisted in fund-detail snapshots. Do not substitute a derived volatility score when the official source value is unavailable. Raw commission values are persisted without percentage conversion, and valor values are persisted as source integer fields without inferred settlement semantics.

## TEFAS portfolio-allocation status

`dagilimSiraliGetirT` exposes 54 observed allocation raw fields after metadata is excluded.

Current validation status:

- **43 / 54** raw allocation fields have verified same-date TEFAS raw/UI business-label mappings.
- **11 / 54** remain unresolved/unobserved:
  - `bb`
  - `db`
  - `dot`
  - `eut`
  - `fkb`
  - `kh`
  - `kks`
  - `t`
  - `vm`
  - `yba`
  - `ymk`

Additional validation was performed across all five supported fund kinds (`YAT`, `EMK`, `BYF`, `GYF`, `GSYF`) and sample dates in both 2025 and 2026.

A total of **12,476 raw portfolio-breakdown rows** were checked for these 11 fields and no non-zero observation was found.

Therefore:

- Do not guess business labels for these 11 fields.
- Preserve them as unknown/unobserved raw fields for future discovery.
- They are not currently a blocker for using the verified active allocation mappings.

## Implemented / established TEFAS metrics

Current metric capability includes:

### Return metrics

- Daily return
- Five-observation return
- One-month return

### Daily evolution metrics

- Investor-count daily change
- Investor-count daily growth ratio
- AUM daily change
- AUM daily growth ratio
- Average AUM per investor
- Shares-outstanding change
- BYF exchange-bulletin metrics where applicable

### Five-observation evolution metrics

- `five_observation_aum_change`
- `five_observation_aum_growth_ratio`
- `five_observation_investor_count_change`
- `five_observation_investor_count_growth_ratio`

### One-month evolution metrics

- `one_month_aum_change`
- `one_month_aum_growth_ratio`
- `one_month_investor_count_change`
- `one_month_investor_count_growth_ratio`

### Estimated net fund flow capability

Estimated net fund flow is classified as `DERIVABLE_FROM_TEFAS`.

Conservative derivation:

```text
estimated_net_fund_flow
    = current_AUM
    - previous_AUM * (current_price / previous_price)
```

This removes the estimated valuation-return effect from the AUM change.

Important limitation:

- This is an **estimated derived flow metric**.
- It is not a direct TEFAS subscription/redemption transaction field.
- Raw investor cash-flow transactions remain unavailable in the verified TEFAS dataset.

## External data-source decision

Current MVP source priority:

1. **TEFAS** — primary source for daily fund data and validated fund-detail/allocation data.
2. **KAP** — preferred official supplementary source when a required disclosure, settlement/value-date field or more granular official fund document cannot be reliably obtained through TEFAS.
3. **FVT** — may be used only as a reference, cross-check or product-analysis inspiration source; it is not a required backend data dependency for the current MVP.

The capability/gap analysis concluded that the current core short-term fund-analysis requirements do not justify adding FVT as a mandatory source.

## Verification performed

Important verified checkpoints include:

- Authentication and Portfolio CRUD were previously verified against PostgreSQL.
- TEFAS fund-kind and daily-column discovery covered `YAT`, `EMK`, `BYF`, `GYF` and `GSYF`.
- Portfolio-allocation raw/UI verification produced 43 verified mappings.
- The 11 unresolved allocation fields were scanned across 12,476 raw rows without a non-zero observation.
- TEFAS detail-page extraction for `fund_category`, `category_rank`, `category_fund_count`, `market_share_raw`, `isin` and `risk_value` is covered by automated tests.
- Official risk value is extracted only from exact matching `profilData["fonKodu"]` and `profilData["riskDegeri"]`; unidentified or other-fund profile data is ignored.
- TEFAS detail-page parsing ignores Next.js reference-string marker occurrences such as `$...:profilData` while preserving strict handling for other decoded non-object marker values.
- Live AAL detail-page smoke verification after this parser robustness change returned `fund_category=Para Piyasası Fonu` and `risk_value=1`.
- TEFAS ISIN is source-confirmed from exact-matching `profilData["isinKodu"]`; missing values normalize to `None`, while present string values are trimmed and uppercased.
- Live ISIN extraction was verified through the service layer for sample YAT, EMK, BYF, GYF and GSYF funds.
- `Asset.isin` is nullable `String(32)` metadata added by migration `20260819_0009`; no unique, index or format constraint is imposed at this stage.
- Fund-detail observation enriches a missing Asset ISIN from already-fetched TEFAS metadata without making an additional provider request; matching values are accepted and conflicting non-null values raise instead of being silently overwritten.
- Asset ISIN enrichment and new snapshot persistence share the same transaction; rollback behavior is covered by tests, including snapshot persistence failure.
- Focused Asset/observation-service test suite: **27 passed**.
- Fresh SQLite migration upgrade through `20260819_0009` passed, and migration round-trip `0009 -> 0008 -> 0009` passed.
- Migration `20260817_0008` adds nullable `risk_value` with a database check constraint limiting non-null values to 1..7.
- Fresh SQLite `alembic upgrade head` passed through revision `20260817_0008`.
- SQLite migration round-trip `0008 -> 0007 -> 0008` passed.
- Focused risk-value test suite: **109 passed**.
- `git diff --check` passed for the risk-value implementation, with Windows LF/CRLF normalization warnings only.
- Multi-kind scheduled daily sync was verified locally for `YAT`, `EMK`, `BYF`, `GYF` and `GSYF`.
- The scheduled flow uses fund-kind-level bulk general-info requests rather than one request per fund.
- Real TEFAS/PostgreSQL smoke test for 2026-08-17 persisted: YAT 2033, EMK 400, BYF 30, GYF 255 and GSYF 539 funds; 3257 TEFAS fund assets were present after the sync.
- Focused scheduled-sync test suite: **20 passed**.
- Focused PR1 TEFAS management-fee client/service extraction tests: **132 passed**.
- Focused TEFAS management-fee history persistence tests: **43 passed**.
- Focused TEFAS management-fee bulk refresh/history sync tests: **57 passed**.
- Focused TEFAS detail-page profile metadata extraction tests: **141 passed**.
- Focused TEFAS detail snapshot model, observation-service and bulk-refresh test suite: **66 passed**.
- Current full backend test-suite result: **675 passed**.
- `git diff --check` passed for the current TEFAS detail-page profile metadata persistence change.
- Short-term evolution metrics were implemented and merged in PR #29.
- Transaction migration `20260825_0012` was applied on real PostgreSQL.
- Transaction migration round-trip `0012 -> 0011 -> 0012` passed.
- Focused Transaction-related suite: **76 passed**.
- Current full backend test-suite result after Transaction foundation: **731 passed**.
- Real PostgreSQL BUY 10 / SELL 4 smoke produced net quantity `6.00000000`.
- Real PostgreSQL `FOR UPDATE` smoke verified a second session was blocked while the first held the portfolio lock.

## Current data-team handoff status

The TEFAS capability/gap analysis requested for Zeynep's data work is complete.

Final high-level classification:

- Core daily fund data → **TEFAS direct**
- Historical/short-term evolution metrics → **TEFAS derived**
- Estimated net fund flow → **TEFAS derived**
- Verified allocation categories → **TEFAS direct**
- 1-year category ranking → **TEFAS direct**
- Official current risk value → **TEFAS direct; backend extraction and snapshot persistence complete**
- Raw subscription/redemption transactions → **unavailable in the verified TEFAS dataset**
- FVT → **not required for current MVP**
- KAP → **official supplementary source when needed**

## Immediate next backend steps

Work in small controlled increments. The TEFAS backend MVP data foundation is complete; remaining provider-specific items are deferred unless a concrete product requirement makes them necessary.

1. **Start Holdings / Positions foundation**
   - Derive current quantities from Transaction history.
   - Transactions remain the source of truth.
   - Do not introduce duplicated persisted holding truth without a concrete need.
   - Before portfolio valuation, evaluate the required asset-price and exchange-rate foundation for multi-currency portfolios.

2. **Preserve the completed TEFAS foundation**
   - Keep the verified daily `YAT`, `EMK`, `BYF`, `GYF` and `GSYF` bulk sync stable.
   - The data team is handling the five-year historical bulk dataset; do not duplicate that collection work.
   - Run focused tests and the full suite before each PR.

## Current open decisions / remaining data gaps

The following TEFAS items are intentionally deferred and do not block the next backend work / Holdings-Positions foundation:

- The 11 portfolio-allocation raw fields (`bb`, `db`, `dot`, `eut`, `fkb`, `kh`, `kks`, `t`, `vm`, `yba`, `ymk`) remain unresolved/unobserved after the existing broad raw-data scan and must not receive guessed labels.
- `girisKomisyonu` extraction and persistence exist, but no non-null live example has been found, so its exact source semantics remain unverified. `cikisKomisyonu` has a verified non-null example and is preserved as the raw TEFAS percentage-point value.
- YAT/EMK management-fee extraction, history persistence and bulk refresh/history sync are implemented. Scheduler/daily-sync/CLI/API integration and BYF/GYF/GSYF management-fee semantics remain deferred.
- `fonProfilDtyGetir` comparison rows are TEFAS performance-comparison series, not the fund's legal benchmark. If an official benchmark or threshold value becomes an MVP requirement, use a separately verified official source such as KAP.
- The old `getFplFonList.tarih` field remains semantically unresolved and must not be treated as fund inception date. The legacy endpoint is not used as a current production source.
- Fund inception/start date and current founder/operator/lifecycle directory metadata require a separately verified current source if they become product requirements.
- Fund-market-share denominator grouping remains unsuitable for a custom derived production metric until the relevant TEFAS grouping semantics are explicitly defined.
- For BYF, observed evidence distinguishes general-info `fiyat` as calculated per-share fund value / NAV from `borsaBultenFiyat` as the exchange-market price; historical `fonFiyatBilgiGetir.fiyat` matched the bulletin price across the verified 2026-04-24 BYF cross-section. Preserve endpoint-specific semantics rather than collapsing the fields.
- TEFAS internal type codes observed through `fonTipiGetir` (`YAT -> F`, `EMK -> M`, `BYF -> N`, `GYF -> 1`, `GSYF -> 0`) are provider-internal metadata and are not persisted as user-facing business classifications. Business-level fund-type history continues to use `fonProfilDtyGetir.fonTuru`.

## Local development commands

On Windows PowerShell, prefer the project's venv Python explicitly when activation is unavailable:

```text
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m alembic upgrade head
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

Git workflow:

- Create a feature branch for each focused implementation slice.
- Do not use `git add .`.
- Stage changed files explicitly.
- Review `git diff --check` and staged changes before commit.
- Push the feature branch and merge through a PR.
- Return local `main` to `origin/main` after merge.

## Current working method

For every backend task:

```text
plan
-> one small step
-> implement
-> run focused tests
-> review result
-> user confirmation
-> next small step
-> full verification
-> explicit stage
-> commit
-> push
-> PR
-> merge
-> update local main
```

Codex usage:

- Do not use Codex for simple PowerShell, Git or test commands.
- Use GPT-5.5 Medium for focused implementation work when Codex materially helps.
- Use GPT-5.5 High only for genuinely critical correctness review.
- Keep Codex prompts short and task-specific.
